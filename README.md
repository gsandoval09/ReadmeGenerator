# Project Title

This project is based on creating a Readme generator. It is created to allow users to easily create a readme file along with custom inputs asking the user a series of questions such as question prompts about the users email, the users github information, and even their type of license they choose to incorporate with their readme file. All this inofrmation is generated at the click of a button once the user has succesffuly entered their information into the terminal.
